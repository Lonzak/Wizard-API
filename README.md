# Wizard-API (Wizard Library)
Copy of Tim Boudreau's Wizard project. Originally hosted at https://wizard.dev.java.net 

It contains the version 1.1 which I didn't find anywhere else in the web.
This is one of the last copies of the svn (from 28.10.2016).

You'll find the original jar and the source.zip in the 'www' folder
